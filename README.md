## Seismic S-wave arrival time prediction using deep learning algorithm

### Basic Information:
This project aims to develop a machine learning algorithm that can predict (1) the seismic S-wave arrival time and (2) can classify the wave types, either seismic or noise, based on fixed-sized signal/noise.

### Codes and Libraies
In this project I used python 3.8. The following libraries are also required:

<li> NumPy
<li> Pandas
<li> matplotlib
<li> scikit-learn
<li> Pytorch
<li> Tensorflow
<li> Cuda
